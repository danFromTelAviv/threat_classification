0,"The scammer portrayed himself as a home improvement specialist.He supposedly fixed a stain on my living room ceiling and sealing the chimney because anytime it would rain heavily the ceiling would get wet.Two weeks later it rained heavily  again and the same problem occured,he said he would come and check it out and try to fix it. But he never did.He keeps giving me the run around saying he's coming but again he doesn't. The invoice he gave me is blank except there's a signature,(i don't know who's)  But he gave it to me so quickly as he was leaving,I didn't have time to check it. So now I'm out of $600. And i will need to pay someone to fix his mess!","Positive fraud examples involve direct deception and personal interaction where victims are intentionally misled into making payments for services or products that are never delivered or falsely represented, whereas negative examples typically involve indirect deceitful practices like misleading advertising, unauthorized billing, or scare tactics without the necessity of personal interaction."

0,"Claims to be a repo/bankruptcy assistance company. The phone number is automated, tells you to press 1 to speak to a consultant immediately. Pressed 1 for a consultant.  It goes straight to voice-mail of a Anthony, who was the person she was working with at the start of her situation. Then a Patrick contacts her stating Anthony is busy and he will help her who doesn't give his last name nor his title. His VM states, ""if you are a client, please call me directly"", but doesn't have a number for clients to contact him. I left a message.  He returns my call from his own personal number, which shocked me, and asked if I was a client, which I'm not, my niece is a client as of March 2024. I asked why he didn't leave a number for clients to call back. He doesn't reply. I expessed my concers with their services they are providing my niece with false information on her repossion of her car.  He said, ""Lady are you on drugs""  which was rude. My niece has done her due diligence on getting all paperwork filed with courts in Arizona, which where she resides.  I asked, why is my niece having to contact her bank regarding her repossession, when his company is the consultants who are suppose to providing her with assistance on this situation. My niece has not been able to speak or receive any information on her situation.  A Patrick contacts her and says that Anthony is working with other clients and he will taking her case over, and asked her to call her bank three way, so he can speak to them regarding her car. It took two days for them to contact the bank three way.  Patrick did not engage in the conversation of her situation nor did he explain to the bank that his company is working with my niece.  He kept promising her she will get her car back once she filed her case with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona, which she has done, and still no car back. Patrick continues insisting she has to contact her bank regarding the repossession. Its been a week with no progress, and her vehicle is still at the repo lot, which lot fees piling up.  Pinnacle Financial Network is the name they give to clients, their website shows Pinnacle Loan Group. I did not find any company with either name. I entered the phone number of the company in Google, and the phone number just says ""not a good number, or might be a scam"". This is such a sad situation that they represent themselves as a financial/repossession /bankruptcy company. Company number they show is 786-434-9050, Anthony's personal number that he calls back on is 305-902-1552. Help my niece and others who have been scammed by them.

1,"This company pretends to be a compliance partner for labor law posters, and they grab buyers' attentions with their ""All-in-One"" poster that needs to be displayed in the workplace in order to be in compliance and not be fined by the government. These same posters can be individually downloaded and printed by your state government's website and the federal government's labor website. Once you buy from this company, you will be repeatedly harassed and threatened by mail, phone, and email to buy another poster.  They use scare tactics to make you think that you aren't in compliance and hope that you'll keep buying more and more. Even when you call and ask to have your phone number removed from the call list, you have to request it multiple times while dealing with rude sales people. Also, even though you request to have your mailing address removed and your account ""stopped or suppressed,"" the mailers keep coming as they are autogenerated. They will even find addresses linked to your name and start sending them mailers too. It's insane!","Positive examples exhibit fraudulent behavior by exploiting fear, urgency, or misinformation to induce repeated, unnecessary financial transactions or compliance actions, whereas negative examples primarily involve one-time deceitful transactions without systematic exploitation."
1,"To enter into Singapore, a non-citizen must fill out an arrival card. This arrival card is free to fill out and should not have fees associated with it. When googling Singapore Arrival Card, a company pops up at the top and directs you to fill out an arrival card. The company says that arrival cards being filled out less and 2 days before arrival need to have an &ldquo;expedited processing fee&rdquo; paid on them.
The real card can be filled out upon arrival, but unsuspecting travelers may not know this and will opt to pay the fee to ensure they can enter the country when they arrive.
The company does fill out a real arrival card and send it to you, however the real service is free, easy to use and doesn&rsquo;t require a company to process it for you. Additionally they are not forthcoming with how much the service will cost and they do not send you a receipt or confirmation of payment.  Later you find a large fee from another company www.onlinetravel-processing.com/ on your credit card. This amount is larger than what you thought you were paying.
Later you learn that you didn&rsquo;t have to pay and that the &ldquo;expedited processing fee&rdquo; was preying on a traveler&rsquo;s anxiety.","Positive examples exhibit fraudulent behavior by exploiting fear, urgency, or misinformation to induce repeated, unnecessary financial transactions or compliance actions, whereas negative examples primarily involve one-time deceitful transactions without systematic exploitation."

The customer service tried to scam me by not giving me a full refund unless I internationally shipped the product back to their warehouse in China. They said they would have to receive it in order to issue a full refund or I could take an option on only receiving less than half a refund and a coupon voucher for their online store. I said no and I would like to return the item for a full refund and they asked me to destroy the product and take a picture of it in order to refund me. They kept changing the refund policy around and started to talk rude and call me names like &ldquo;stubborn&rdquo;. They were not professional and continued to refuse to send me a correct return address. The return address was for a warehouse in China and the address was not correctly formatted. Because of that, I would have been tricked into sending the product back to end up getting lost and not receive a full refund.

I was scheduled for a group interview, assuming I was being interviewed by a group. When I hop on a call, I noticed there was one representative from ""the company"" who was not a recruiter; he was a sales person by the name of ""Kate Von-Strove"" young caucasian male early 20s or late teens. I was on the call with 25 other people who were apparently interviewing for the same position. None of the people had experience in the role they were interviewing for. The people interviewing for the position all evidently came from marginalized backgrounds and people ""chasing the dollar"" of a position that is guaranteeing you to make a lot of money. The company representative said that basically everyone will get a job offer by the end of the call (which raises concern that they might be stealing peoples Social Security Number or Identification). The interview was mostly a sales pitch promising people they were going to make a lot of money, nothing much about the company, or history or the founders, or current customers, etc. As I was on this call, I googled the name of the company and according to Reddit and Quora, other people reported this company to be a scam and that they have been changing company names as they've been running into legal issues in the past.

13,"<p>I signed up for Surfshark VPN service which was fine for the nearly 2 year window that I used them but I decided I didn't want to use their service after the contracting period. I called them very early to indicate that I wanted to not have my service auto-renew and that I didn't want my personal payment saved. They said they wouldn't auto-renew.
About 2 weeks before the end of the 2 year contracting period, I received an email saying I would be charged for the next year and not only that but they would be doubling the cost that I paid for the yearly - essentially making me pay 2 years worth for 1 year. I found this confusing so I logged into my account at Surfshark's website to find that I had been flagged to auto-renew. I attempted to turn off the auto-renew function but the button to do so didn't exist. I looked up online how to stop auto-renew and found thousands of posts on quora and reddit stating that people had been fleeced for the next year's costs due to being unable to stop the service charge and they had them in a hard spot due to Paypal being the source payment target.
I found a post of a person who had worked out a round about way to undo auto-payment - I used their link to ask the chatbot service on Surfshark a specific question and it would send a link for me to account verify and the backend would switch the button to ""off"" for auto-renew. I went through the process and it worked but I read some response posts saying they were still charged. So I investigated further and found that if you go into ""Change your Payment Method"" section of the site it says ""Auto-renewal will be enabled, and your current subscription will renew automatically on [my date 2 weeks out] for $83.07."" Basically me jumping through the backend hoops to now have money stolen from me didn't matter - they were going to turn auto-renew back on without my consent or knowledge and steal money from me that it would take great effort to get back. I ended up contacting them and having my account expunged but I am unsure if that will even stop them from stealing my money.
This is completely unethical and, if it isn't, it should be illegal. Surfshark is likely making millions off this scam. I don't know what action can be taken but any help in this effort to stop them would be greatly appreciated.</p>
